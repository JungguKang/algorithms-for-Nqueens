# algorithms-for-Nqueens
This repository contains several algorithms to solve N-queens algorithm.
## N-Queens problem
There is an chess board which is a size of NxN, and must allocate N numbers of queens.
Each queen can attack all horizontal, vertical and diagonal blocks from her standing block.
In this N-Queens problem, each Queen must be allocated not attacking each other.
